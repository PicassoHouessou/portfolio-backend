        brief: "I have a degree in Computer Science with a major in Computer Network Administration. I work on system and network administration projects, but also on the creation of websites and web applications. I enjoy thinking and investing my time on new projects, because each project is unique and you learn new things and gain experience as long as you invest yourself in it; and that's what I do or try to do the best I can. I am very open and it is always a pleasure to exchange, to combine common efforts and to discover new horizons.I have a degree in Computer Science with a major in Computer Network Administration.
